# Gonzo for TYPO3

Take control of your Page URLs in TYPO3 v9.


## Installation

Install it via TER (extension key "gonzo") or via composer: `composer req b13/gonzo`

Afterwards activate the extension via Extension Manager. You should see a new module in the TYPO3 Backend.


## What does it do

* Changing URLs allows to also change URLs that start with the same path when editing a page.
* A new backend module allows to mass-change URLs starting with a certain URL to a different URL (Dialog box needed).
* Changing URLs allows to add (temporary) redirects when the redirects extension is installed.
* A list of recently changed URLs also shows a good track record on what has happened recently.
* Allow to exclude a certain page when generating URLs for its subpages.

## ToDo

- Everything.
- Use local vue.js and vue components.
